    <h2>Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      Cybersecurity is a vast and ever-evolving field. Without a clear roadmap, itâ€™s easy to feel overwhelmed or lost. Thatâ€™s why having a structured learning path is essentialâ€”it helps you build foundational knowledge, develop practical skills, and progress toward specialized roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're starting from scratch or pivoting from another tech domain, this roadmap outlines a logical progression that balances theory, hands-on practice, and certification milestones.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Learn the basics â€“ networking, operating systems, and security fundamentals.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Practice hands-on skills using platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Earn foundational certifications like Security+ to validate your knowledge.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Explore specialized areas â€“ ethical hacking, incident response, cloud security.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Pursue advanced certifications and build real-world projects to showcase your skills.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This roadmap isnâ€™t rigidâ€”itâ€™s a flexible guide that you can adapt based on your interests and career goals. The key is consistency, curiosity, and a willingness to learn from both successes and setbacks.

    <h2>Cybersecurity Certificates</h2>
    <p>
      Certifications are more than just credentialsâ€”theyâ€™re proof of your dedication, knowledge, and readiness to tackle real-world security challenges. In a field where trust and expertise are paramount, having recognized certifications can be the difference between landing a job or being overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Employers often use certifications to benchmark candidates, especially in roles involving penetration testing, network defense, or compliance. They also help you stay current with evolving threats, tools, and methodologies.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some popular certifications to consider:</p>
    <ul class="links">
      <li><strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> â€“ A foundational cert for beginners covering core security concepts.</li>
      <li><strong>CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)</strong> â€“ Focuses on ethical hacking techniques and tools.</li>
      <li><strong>CISSP</strong> â€“ A globally recognized cert for experienced security professionals.</li>
      <li><strong>OSCP</strong> â€“ A hands-on, practical certification for offensive security skills.</li>
      <li><strong>GIAC</strong> â€“ Offers specialized certs in areas like incident response, forensics, and cloud security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many of these certifications require rigorous study and hands-on practice, but theyâ€™re well worth the effort. They signal to employers that youâ€™re serious about cybersecurity and capable of protecting digital assets.
